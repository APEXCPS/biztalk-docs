# Tracing and Debugging
Transaction Integrator (TI) provides low impact performance monitoring for call volumes, processing time, and data throughput capable of isolating each major participant (host, TI, the .NET Framework, and client) to the specific details of transaction type and programming model supported. This support is turned on or off by the administrator online.
