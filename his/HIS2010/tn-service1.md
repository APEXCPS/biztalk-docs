# TN Service
TN Service, which is based on the Telnet protocol, enables a user at one site to connect and interact with a remote system at another site using the TCP/IP network protocol. When connecting to a remote computer, the initiating computer acts as a terminal for the remote computer. [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] supports TN3270-style and TN5250-style sessions in addition to native [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] client 3270 and 5250 sessions.
