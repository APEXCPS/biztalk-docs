# Tracing Servers Components
The [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] Trace application can be started locally or remotely for a Host Integration Server computer. For a client computer, the Host Integration Server Trace application can only be started locally.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  All procedures listed in this section assume that Trace is running on a computer that has Host Integration Server installed and configured.
