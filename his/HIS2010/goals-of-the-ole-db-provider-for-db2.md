# Goals of the OLE DB Provider for DB2
Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are one of the major sources of mission-critical information in today's enterprise organizations. Relational database technology enables departments and individual users to save their information in centrally managed database stores that can be easily maintained by the organization's information systems group. Specific query tools designed for accessing relational database systems have added greater flexibility and ease of access to this information.  
  
 These same enterprises rely on vast networks of personal computers to enable their users to achieve business goals. End users invariably rely on network e-mail; Windows productivity applications, such as Office; and personal database programs, such as Access, to accomplish their daily tasks. It is essential for these same users to incorporate data stored in relational database systems into their regular correspondence, analysis, and reports.  
  
 The challenge for enterprise IT  is how to provide access to this valuable data without the effort involved in developing traditional database applications. Much of the renewed interest in improved access to data sources is a result of the growth in the use Web technology as mechanisms for delivering information, analysis and reporting using SQL Server, and collaboration through SharePoint Server. Fast and inexpensive methods of accessing data stored in RDBMS systems are necessary to deliver modern, three-tiered information systems during this era of cost cutting and budget tightening.  
  
 IBM DB2 is a popular RDBMS for a significant number of enterprise customers. Customers need a cost-effective and manageable means to integrate DB2 with SQL Server, Internet Information Services (IIS), and Office applications. The goal of the OLE DB Provider for DB2 is to provide customers and solution providers with the means to integrate desktop applications with this wealth of data residing on DB2 database systems.
