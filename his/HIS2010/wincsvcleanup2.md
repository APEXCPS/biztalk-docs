# WinCSVCleanup
The **WinCSVCleanup** function terminates and deregisters an application from a WindowsÂ® CSV implementation.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
BOOL WINAPI WinCSVCleanup(void);  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 The return value specifies whether the deregistration was successful. If the value is nonzero, the application was successfully deregistered. The application was not deregistered if a value of zero is returned.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use **WinCSVCleanup** to indicate deregistration of a Windows CSV application from a Windows CSV implementation. This function can be used, for example, to free up resources allocated to the specific application.
