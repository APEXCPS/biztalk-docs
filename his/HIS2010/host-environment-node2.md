# Host Environment Node
Use the ***Host Environment*** node to manage the properties of a host environment.  
  
 Right-click the ***Host Environment*** node to view the following three options:  
  
-   **Refresh**. Redraws the screen to show any updates.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the ***host environment* Properties** dialog box and four tabbed property pages:  
  
    -   **General**  
  
    -   **Network**  
  
    -   **Conversion**  
  
    -   **Default**  
  
     Use these property pages to view or change the properties of the host environment.  
  
-   **Help**. Displays a Help topic (this topic) that explains the items that appear in the TI Manager console and the actions you can take.
