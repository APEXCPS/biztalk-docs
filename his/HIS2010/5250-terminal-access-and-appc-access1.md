# 5250 Terminal Access and APPC Access
Users who want Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) access need not be defined in the SNA subdomain, but they must be members of a Windows domain.  
  
 For 5250 terminal access using a Host Integration Server client computer within the network, the AS/400 supplies the required security for logon to the AS/400.  
  
 For APPC access programmed into specific applications, you maintain security through the actual programmatic conversation, if required.
