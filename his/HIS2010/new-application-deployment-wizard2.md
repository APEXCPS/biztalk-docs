# New Application Deployment Wizard
The **New Application Deployment Wizard** helps you add a new application by guiding you through the definitions of the application, local environment, host environment, and objects. The wizard can be used to define additional local environments, host environments, or objects and link them to existing definitions. You can access the Wizard from the shortcut menu on the ***computer*** node in the TI Manager console tree.
