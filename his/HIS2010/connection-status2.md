# Connection Status
The [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] SNA Manager offers six different messages that indicate the status of a connection:  
  
-   Active  
  
-   Pending  
  
-   Stopping  
  
-   Inactive  
  
-   On Demand: Indicates that the connection is available to be started when needed. On Demand connections can also have all of the statuses listed above.  
  
-   Incoming: Indicates that the connection is available to receive incoming calls. Incoming connections can also have all of the statuses listed above.  
  
 To view a connection status, simply select the appropriate connection in the SNA Manager.
