# Protect the .NET Servers
To prevent an attacker from spoofing their identity, tampering with the data on the host, elevating their privileges, accessing restricted data, or denying service, you should:  
  
-   Use static IP addresses on the host  
  
-   Run server components in-process with a HIP Service account.  
  
 You can also help mitigate this threat with the following deployment scenario:  
  
-   Send properly-formatted messages (for example, ELM, TRM, DPL, SNA, IP)
