# LUA Samples
The source code for several sample programs that illustrate using logical unit application (LUA) are included in the Host Integration Server SDK.  
  
 These files are copied to your hard drive during Host Integration Server software or Host Integration Client software installation when the Host Integration Server Software Development Kit option is selected. These samples are installed in the Samples\SNA subdirectory below where the Host Integration Server SDK software is installed (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Host Integration Server 2010\SDK\Samples\NetworkIntegration\LUA, by default).  
  
 These sample programs include the following files.  
  
|Sample transaction program (TP)|Description|  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|RUI3270|Sample code for a simple emulator based on using the Request Unit Interface (RUI) API. Sample code is provided for Win32 applications|  
|SLI3270|Sample code for a simple emulator based on using the Session Level Interface (SLI) API. Sample code is provided for Win32 applications|  
  
 These samples show how to build a simple 3270 emulator using either the RUI or SLI API. This emulator does not interpret the data it receives from the host, but does demonstrate how to use the APIs to establish a session with the host.
