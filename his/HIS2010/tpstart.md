# TPSTART
An autostarted TP that runs as an application under Microsoft Windows requires the support of the TPSTART program, which is installed with the Microsoft Host Integration Server software in the SYSTEM subdirectory of the Host Integration Server root directory. Therefore, the TPSTART program must be started on a Windows-based client before an autostarted invokable TP can be started as an application. You can start TPSTART by using standard Windows methods, such as including TPSTART in the **Startup** group on the client.
