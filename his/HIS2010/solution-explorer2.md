# Solution Explorer
Visual Studio Solution Explorer provides an organized view of projects and their files, in addition to access to available commands and toolbars. The following files are supported by the project:  
  
-   .NET Client-Initiated libraries, which are Microsoft .NET Framework assemblies.  
  
-   Host-Initiated libraries, which are annotated Microsoft .NET Framework assemblies (.dll).  
  
 With HIS 2010 HIP, Designer no longer generates both a .tim and .dll. The HIP configuration requires only a .dll.  
  
 **To open Solution Explorer**  
  
-   On the **View** menu, click **Solution Explorer**.
