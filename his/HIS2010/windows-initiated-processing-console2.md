# Windows-Initiated Processing Console
The Windows-initiated processing (WIP) console supports the .NET Framework, TCP/IP, and SNA environments, with .NET Framework assemblies having similar capabilities and functioning.  
  
 There are two primary configuration elements for the WIP environment:  
  
-   **Remote environments.** The remote environments folder contains the definitions, called remote environments or REs, for the non-Windows host computers that receive requests from the WIP components.  
  
-   **Objects.** The objects folder contains the metadata definitions for the client proxy objects that were created through the Host Integration Server Designer (HIS Designer).  
  
 The Internet Information Services node is used to configure the virtual directories used by WIP .NET Framework objects.
