# Viewing Connections
As with other connections, you can view IP-DLC link service connections in the list view of the **Connections** folder.  
  
### To view connections  
  
1.  In the scope pane of the [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] MMC snap-in, locate the computer with the link services that you want to view.  
  
2.  Expand the list for that computer, expand **SNA Service**, and expand **Connections**. The link service connections for that computer will appear in the right pane.
