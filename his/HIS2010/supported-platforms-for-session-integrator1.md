# Supported Platforms for Session Integrator
Session Integrator is designed to be used with [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)], and is therefore supported on all platforms that support [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)].
