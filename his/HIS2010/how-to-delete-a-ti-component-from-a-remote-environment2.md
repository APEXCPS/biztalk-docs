# How to Delete a TI Component from a Remote Environment
Deleting a Transaction Integrator (TI) component from a remote environment (RE) deletes that component from the COM+ application. You can delete only one component at a time.  
  
### To delete a TI component from an RE  
  
1.  Start TI Manager.  
  
2.  In the console tree, double-click **Transaction Integrator** for the appropriate computer, double-click **Remote Environments**, and then double-click the RE that contains the component to be deleted.  
  
3.  Right-click the component to be deleted, and click **Delete**.  
  
4.  Click **Yes** to delete the selected component.  
  
     To reinstate the component, add it back into the COM+ application.
