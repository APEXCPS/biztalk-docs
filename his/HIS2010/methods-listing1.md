# Methods Listing
Use the methodslistingto view the properties of the methods on the object view.  
  
 This listing displays the following information about the method:  
  
-   **Method**. The name of the method.  
  
-   **Endpoint**. The endpoint used to communicate with the host.  
  
-   **Resolution Type**. The type of conflict to be conducted in case of a conflict.  
  
-   **Msg Handler**.  
  
-   **Resolution String**.  
  
-   **Position**. The starting point in the data stream where the TI runtime looks for the data defined in the resolution data field to determine what method is to be executed.  
  
-   **Comment**. Additional information about the view.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  If you view the list in the right pane of TI Manager and change the order of the columns using the **Add/Remove Columns** command on the shortcut menu, the order of the column headings might not be correct after you close and re-open TI Manager. The next time you open TI Manager, the values in the columns are displayed in the new order you set, but the column headings are in the their default order.  
  
 If you observe that the column headings are no longer in the order you set:  
  
1.  Right-click the node, point to **View**, and then click **Add/Remove Columns**.  
  
2.  On the **Add/Remove Columns** dialog box, click **Restore Defaults**.  
  
3.  Click a different node, then click the node you were just working on.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The columns should now be in their original order.  
  
 Right-click the methodname to view the following two options:  
  
-   **Refresh** Redraws the screen to show any updates.  
  
-   **Help**. Displays a Help topic (this topic) that explains the items that appear in the TI Manager console and the actions you can take.
