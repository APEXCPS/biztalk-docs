# WMI and Host Integration Server
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a component of the Microsoft Windows operating system that provides management information and control in an enterprise environment. In the context of Microsoft Host Integration Server, WMI provides a programming and scripting interface for four major administrative tasks: configuration, run-time control, health monitoring, and trace capturing.
