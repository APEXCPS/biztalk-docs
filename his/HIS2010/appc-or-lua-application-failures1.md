# APPC or LUA Application Failures
These applications may be written internally, or may be commercial applications. If an error code is produced on an APPC application, it is documented in the "APPC Applications."  
  
 An LUA application may produce error codes which are found in the "LUA Applications," or the IBM SNA Formats Guide.  
  
 If you are able to test a 3270 or 5250 connection, that can help you determine whether you are experiencing a connectivity problem or a problem with the application itself.
