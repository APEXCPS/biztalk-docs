# SNALink Concepts in Host Integration Server
This section describes key concepts used in the SNALink feature of [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)]. Because the purpose of this section is to enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and adapter vendors to develop link support software to integrate their hardware adapters into a [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] system, only the relevant parts of the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] architecture are described.
