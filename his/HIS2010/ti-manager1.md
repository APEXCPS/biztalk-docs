# TI Manager
TI Manager a design-time administrative tool that is hosted inside, and uses the graphical user interface, of the Microsoft Management Console. You use TI Manager to configure end-points, associate resources with requests, and define security and access rules. The rules and mapping of the data transformations are created in the Transaction Integrator (TI) Designer. TI Manager configures, administers, and manages TI objects and the TI run-time environment settings they contain.
