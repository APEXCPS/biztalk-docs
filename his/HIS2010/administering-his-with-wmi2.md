The Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) providers for Host Integration Server are designed as programming and scripting administration interfaces. As such, these providers are optimized to perform get and set information, and to start and stop services. The following section describes what components of Host Integration Server you can administer with WMI, and what tasks you can perform on those components.
