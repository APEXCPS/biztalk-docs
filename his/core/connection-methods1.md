# Connection Methods
[!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] supports many different connection methods. However, not all may be available in your environment. When you choose a connection method, you should keep in mind:  
  
-   Deployment model you are implementing  
  
-   Host networking infrastructure that is in place  
  
-   Host systems to which you are connecting  
  
-   Expected usage level of host resources  
  
-   Level of performance and response expected by your users
