# How to Deploy a Host File Interface
Once you have finished importing and modifying the host file interface, you can deploy the interface. Deploying the interface allows you to write and test code against the interface.  
  
### To deploy a Host File interface  
  
1.  In HIS Designer, select the tab that has the name of the assembly to deploy.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, confirm that you have selected the remote environment that you want your assembly to communicate with.  
  
3.  In the HIS tree node, right-click on the name of the assembly, and select **Deploy**.
