# CICS Tables
CICS uses the following tables to define LU 6.2 information:  
  
-   Terminal Control Table (TCT)—defines the remote systems to CICS.  
  
-   Program Control Table (PCT)—defines the local TPs to CICS.  
  
-   Program Processing Table (PPT)—defines the load module characteristics to CICS.  
  
 The following sections describe these tables, and include sample definitions to illustrate how they are used.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These samples assume there are four TPs residing on CICS written in PL/I with the following names: TRAN0, TRAN1, TRAN2, and TRAN3.  
  
 This section contains:  
  
-   [Terminal Control Table](../core/terminal-control-table1.md)  
  
-   [Program Control Table](../core/program-control-table2.md)  
  
-   [Program Processing Table](../core/program-processing-table1.md)
