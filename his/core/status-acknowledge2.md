# Status-Acknowledge
**Status-Acknowledge** messages flow between the application and the local node as part of the outbound and inbound data acknowledgment protocols. For a detailed description of outbound and inbound acknowledgment protocols, see [Data Flow](../core/data-flow2.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The format of this message is slightly different for messages from the application to the local node on the primary logical unit (PLU) connection, as is explained in the following topic [Status-Acknowledge(Ack)](../core/status-acknowledge-ack-1.md)
