# Planning Your Hardware
Because [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] can be used in a wide variety of situations, there is no simple formula for the amount of processing power a specific computer needs. The information provided in this topic can help you evaluate your hardware requirements, including:  
  
-   A list of elements that reduce or increase demands on hardware. This helps you estimate the general level of your processing requirements. For example, a Host Integration Server computer can serve as many as 1500 to 2500 users. This indicates a need for large amounts of processing power, perhaps a Pentium processor with 64 or 128 megabytes (MB) of RAM. However, if your servers each support 500 users and most of those users connect briefly and at random times during the day, less processing power is needed.  
  
-   Ways to evaluate the current demand on an existing Host Integration Server computer, and the ability of the existing hardware to support that demand. This gives you a valuable baseline from which to work.
