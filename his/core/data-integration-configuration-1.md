# Data Integration (Configuration)
The information in the following sections will help you configure data sources using the data providers for DB2 and for Host Files.  
  
 You can use the classes in the Microsoft.HostIntegration.DataAccessLibrary Namespace to automate defining packages and data sources. For the reference documentation, see <xref:Microsoft.HostIntegration.DataAccessLibrary>.  
  
 The topics  in the SQL Server and Office sections describe new features and functionality in SQL Server 2008 R2 and Office 2010 that facilitate connecting to and incorporating data from IBM databases and file systems into new or existing applications.
