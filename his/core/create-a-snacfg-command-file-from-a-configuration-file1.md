# Create a Snacfg Command File from a Configuration File
To create lines for a **snacfg** command file, you can type them, or you can generate them by using the **/print** option. The **/print** option accesses an existing configuration file and generates the command-line(s) required to add an individual resource or (depending on syntax) the entire configuration file.  
  
 The output generated by the **/print** option does not contain the word **snacfg**. This means that the output can be included in a **snacfg** command file.
