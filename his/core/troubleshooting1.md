# Troubleshooting
A variety of diagnostic methods and tools are available to troubleshoot Microsoft [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)]. These methods and tools can provide information about the status of services, connections, 3270, APPC and LUA sessions, and performance.
