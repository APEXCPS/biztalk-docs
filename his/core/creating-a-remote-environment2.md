# Creating a Remote Environment
Remote environment (RE) definitions are created and managed from the Remote Environments folder. When the WIP (Windows-initiated processing) Console is first started, the remote environment folder is empty.  
  
 A remote environment defines the network, hardware, and software characteristics of the non-Windows host that will be receiving requests from the Windows operating system. For example, a CICS host that uses the TCP/IP protocol to receive requests from Windows is identified to WIP through an RE that contains the IP address of the Host, the Port Number being listened on, and the code page that the host uses to represent its data.
