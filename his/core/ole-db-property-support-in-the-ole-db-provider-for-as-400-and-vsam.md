# OLE DB Property Support in the OLE DB Provider for AS-400 and VSAM
The following table summarizes the provider-specific OLE DB version 2.0 properties in the SNAOLEDB_DBPROPSET_DBINIT property set that are supported by the current version of Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM.  
  
|OLE DB Property ID|Description|  
|------------------------|-----------------|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_APPCMODE|When logical unit (LU) 6.2 (SNA) is selected for the Network Transport Library (DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_NETTYPE), this property is the Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) mode and must be set to a value that matches the host configuration and SNA server configuration.<br /><br /> Legal values for the APPC mode include QPCSUPP (common system default often used by 5250), #INTER (interactive), #INTERSC (interactive with minimal routing security), #BATCH (batch), #BATCHSC (batch with minimal routing security), #IBMRDB (DB2 remote database access), and custom modes. The following modes that support bidirectional LZ89 compression are also legal: #INTERC (interactive with compression), INTERCS (interactive with compression and minimal routing security), BATCHC (batch with compression), and BATCHCS (batch with compression and minimal routing security).<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property normally defaults to QPCSUPP.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_BINASCHAR|This property indicates whether to process binary fields (Character Code Set Identifier or CCSID of 65535) as character data type fields on a per data source basis. The host CCSID and PC Code Page values are required input parameters when this parameter is true.<br /><br /> This VT_BOOL type property defaults to VARIANT_FALSE, do not process binary fields as character fields.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_HCDPATH|The fully qualified file name of the distributed data management (DDM) host column description (HCD) file. This parameter can be an UNC string up to 256 characters in length. A path does not need to be included in the name if the HCD file is located in the SNA system directory.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR type property is required when connecting to mainframe systems and is optional when connecting to OS/400.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_HOSTCCSID|The CCSID matching the data as represented on the host. This property is required when processing binary data as character data. Unless the DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_BINASCHAR property is set to **true**, character data is converted based on the host column CCSID and default ANSI code page.<br /><br /> This VT_I4 property defaults to U.S./Canada (37).|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_LIBRARY|The default AS/400 library to be accessed.<br /><br /> This VT_BSTR property is not required for mainframe access and is optional when connecting to AS/400 files.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_LOCALLU|When LU 6.2 (SNA) is selected for the Network Transport Library, this property is the name of the local LU alias configured in the SNA server.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_NETADDRESS|When TCP/IP has been selected for the Network Transport Library, this property is used to locate the target host computer. This parameter indicates the IP address or TCP/IP host name alias associated with the DDM server on the host. The network address is required when connecting through TCP/IP.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_NETPORT|When TCP/IP has been selected for the Network Transport Library, this property is used to locate the target DDM service access port when connecting by using TCP/IP. This parameter represents the TCP/IP port used for communication with the DDM service on the host.<br /><br /> The default value for the VT_BSTR type property is 446.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_NETTYPE|This property which represents the dynamic link library used for transport designates whether the provider connects by using SNA LU 6.2 or TCP/IP for network communication. The possible values for this parameter are TCP/IP or SNA.<br /><br /> If TCP/IP is selected, values for Network Address (DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_NETADDRESS) and Network Port (DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_NETPORT) are required. TCP/IP connectivity to the mainframe is not supported by OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM.<br /><br /> If SNA is selected, values for APPC Local LU Alias (DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_LOCALLU), APPC Mode Name (DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_APPCMODE), and APPC Remote LU Alias (DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_REMOTELU) are required.<br /><br /> This value for this VT_BSTR property defaults to SNA.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_PCCODEPAGE|The PC Code Page property ID indicates the code page to be used on the computer for character code conversion. This property is required when processing binary data as character data. Unless DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_BINASCHAR is set to true, character data is converted based on the default ANSI code page configured in Windows.<br /><br /> If this parameter is set to Binary or 65535, no character code conversions will take place.<br /><br /> The default value for this VT_I4 type property is 1252 (Latin-1).|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_REMOTELU|When LU 6.2 (SNA) is selected for the Network Transport Library (DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_NETTYPE), this property ID is the name of the remote LU alias configured in the SNA server.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_REPAIRKEY|This property ID provides for repair of invalid key offsets received from OS/400 when keys have been defined using the Digital Data System (DDS) "RENAME" clause. This parameter indicates whether the OLE DB provider should repair any host key values set in the registry.<br /><br /> This VT_BOOL type property defaults to VARIANT_FALSE.|  
|DBPROP_SNAOLEDB_STRICTVAL|This property indicates whether strict validation should be used.<br /><br /> This VT_BOOL type property defaults to VARIANT_FALSE.|
