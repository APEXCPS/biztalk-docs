# Application Integration (Troubleshooting)
Use the information in this section to troubleshoot problems in your .NET Framework-based client application and Transaction Integrator (TI).  
  
 **General Tips**  
  
 Here are some general tips to help you troubleshoot problems with .NET applications:  
  
-   Collect and analyze error message information.  
  
-   Collect and analyze Windows Event Log information. Gather all available error information: HRESULT values, error strings, and information in the Windows Logs. For more information, see [Checking the Windows Event Logs for Errors](../core/how-to-check-the-windows-event-logs-for-errors2.md).
