# Conversion from Host to OLE DB Data Types
The external record description for data files residing on mainframes is configured in a host column description (HCD) file using the Host File Designer. This HCD file is used to convert from host EBCDIC data types to ASCII C data types for the computer in the DDM client. These C data types are then mapped to OLE DB data types by the SNAOLEDB provider.
