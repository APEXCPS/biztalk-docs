# Objects
The Objects folder contains the metadata definitions for the Client Proxy objects that were created through the Application Integrator Designer. These metadata definitions contain the following:  
  
-   The .NET Framework qualified namespace of the callable .NET Framework class (in the form of a .NET Framework assembly).  
  
-   Conversion annotations used by the Windows-initiated processing (WIP) Runtime to interoperate with the host application program environment.  
  
-   A representation of the callable .NET Framework object  
  
 The metadata definition files are Transaction Integrator metadata files (*.dll) generated by the Application Integrator Designer. The folder contains information about finding these metadata files and their relationships with remote environments and Virtual Directories (.NET).
