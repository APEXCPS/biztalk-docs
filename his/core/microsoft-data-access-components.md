# Microsoft Data Access Components
When connecting over SNA using LU 6.2, the OLE DB Provider for DB2 requires the following computer-to-host connectivity software:  
  
-   Microsoft [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)]  
  
-   Microsoft Host Integration Server Client  
  
 When connecting to a host system using TCP/IP, the OLE DB Provider for DB2 does not require any special host connectivity software.  
  
 The OLE DB Provider for DB2 supports the following OLE DB and ADO versions:  
  
-   OLE DB version 2.5. The Host Integration Server data access features require the run-time libraries for OLE DB version 2.5. These OLE DB libraries are installed as part of the Windows operating systems.  
  
-   ADO version 2.5. The Host Integration Server data access features require the run-time libraries for ADO version 2.5. On Windows, these ADO libraries are installed as part of the Windows operating systems.
