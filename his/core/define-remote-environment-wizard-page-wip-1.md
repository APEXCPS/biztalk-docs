# Define Remote Environment Wizard Page (WIP)
Use the **Define Remote Environment** wizard page to select a remote environment (RE) that provides the connection information to the host application. You can select the RE from the list of already defined remote environments that are of the appropriate type (that is, the network, host environment, and programming model of the remote environment must agree with those of the object).

|**Remote environments**|Select a remote environment. The contents of this list are populated from an enumeration of the remote environments already defined which match in network type, host environment and programming model.|
