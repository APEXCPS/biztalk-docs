# OLE DB Provider for AS-400 and VSAM Programmer&#39;s Guide
The OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM enables you to directly access record-level data in mainframe VSAM, partitioned data sets (PDSs), and midrange i5/OS (formerly known as OS/400 or AS/400) files from within an OLE-aware application. The object linking and embedding database (OLE DB) is a standard set of interfaces that provide heterogeneous access to disparate sources of information located anywhere—file systems, e-mail folders, and databases. The OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM combines the universal data access of OLE DB with the Record-Level Input/Output (RLIO) protocol of the IBM distributed data management (DDM) architecture.  
  
 DDM is a set of rules for distributing or extending the data management from one computer to another, such as from a mainframe to an AS/400 computer, or from one of these host computers to a server computer. By combining the OLE DB and DDM architectures, Microsoft enables organizations to preserve their investments in an existing data management infrastructure, while extending universal data access to all enterprise-wide data sources.  
  
 For API references and other technical information about the OLE DB provider, see the [OLE DB Providers Programmer's Reference](../core/ole-db-providers-programmer-s-reference1.md) section of the SDK.
