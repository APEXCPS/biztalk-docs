# Start SimHost for the Discriminated Union Tutorial
The second step in [Tutorial 1: Creating a Project that Uses Discriminated Unions](../core/tutorial-1-creating-a-project-that-uses-discriminated-unions.md) turns on SimHost, which simulates a remove mainframe for the tutorial to connect to.  
  
## Procedures  
  
#### To start SimHost for the discriminated union tutorial  
  
1.  Right-click **Start**, and then click **Explore**.  
  
2.  Locate the SimHost folder.  
  
     For this tutorial, the SimHost folder is located in \<*Installation directory*>\Program Files\Microsoft Host Integration Server\System.  
  
3.  Double-click SimHost.exe.  
  
     This starts the Microsoft Transaction Integrator Host Simulator. You can use the Host Simulator to simulate a Host Environment. For this tutorial, you will use it to act as a remote Host operating over a TCP/IP CICS connection.  
  
4.  Click **Start TCP**.
