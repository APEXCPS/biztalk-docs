# Programmer&#39;s Guide
Host Integration Server provides comprehensive bidirectional services for integrating Microsoft Windows with legacy systems.  
  
 Most of the services provided by Host Integration Server expose a programming interface, which enables you to extend the functionality of the product and integrate it more tightly in your own environment. This guide describes these interfaces and provides guidance on how to use them.
