# .NET Server Library Wizard
This wizard is a two-page wizard. The first page collects library information, and the second page collects host environment information. In addition, you can use a **Welcome** page, and a **Finish** page to display summary information.  
  
 When you select the platform that you want from the [Add New Item Dialog Box (Visual Studio)](../core/add-new-item-dialog-box-visual-studio-2.md), the generated client component is the Microsoft .NET Framework assembly. When you create the file, it is added to the project and displayed in Solution Explorer.
