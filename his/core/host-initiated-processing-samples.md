# Host-Initiated Processing Samples
Transaction Integrator supports host-initiated processing (HIP) that is, a workflow in which a host-based application is a client to a COM-based or .NET Framework-based server program running on the Microsoft Windows operating system. The HostInitiated folder contains samples designed to demonstrate various aspects of HIP.
