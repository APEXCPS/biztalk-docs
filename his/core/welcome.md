# Welcome
The Installation Wizard for Host Integration Server is similar to other Windows-based applications. The Installation Wizard calls Windows Installer and coordinates the installation process from beginning to end, terminating when the last component is installed. If you do not have the software prerequisites installed, then the Installation Wizard will install them from the Web or a pre-downloaded CAB file.
