# APPC Samples
The [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] SDK includes the source code for several sample programs that illustrate using Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC). These sample programs are copied to your hard drive during Host Integration Server software or Host Integration Client software installation when the **Host Integration Server Software Development Kit** option is selected. These samples are installed in the Samples\NetworkIntegration\APPC subdirectory where the Host Integration Server SDK software is installed (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Host Integration Server 2010\SDK, by default).  
  
 These APPC sample programs include the following:  
  
|APPC TP samples|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|[APPC Send and Receive TPs](../core/appc-send-and-receive-tps.md)|Sample programs in C that represent simple APPC send and receive transaction programs (TPs) illustrating the use of asynchronous verb completion. The samples located in the SENDRECV subdirectory implement simple bulk data sending and receiving TPs (SENDTP and RECVTP).|  
|[Multithreaded Send and Receive TPs](../core/multithreaded-send-and-receive-tps.md)|Sample programs in C that represent more advanced APPC send and receive TPs illustrating the use of multiple threads and multiple conversations per thread. The multithreaded receive TP samples illustrate using events or IO completion ports for notification|
