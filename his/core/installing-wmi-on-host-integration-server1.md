# Installing WMI on Host Integration Server
[!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] should automatically install the relevant files for you to use the relevant Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) interfaces. However, you may have to modify the location of certain managed object format (MOF) files if you want to use WMI on remote servers, and you may have to modify certain security settings if you want to have WMI work correctly as well.
