# Development
The SDK section of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[hisHostIntServNoVersion](../includes/hishostintservnoversion-md.md)] Help provides information for you to write applications for Microsoft Host Integration Server 2010.  
  
 **Using Help in a Developer Environment**  
  
 Host Integration Server Help contains features that you can use to display the developer documentation in the language that you select and you can link between Host Integration Server Help and Visual Studio Help.  
  
 **Using Language Filtering**  
  
 The Host Integration Server .NET Framework Class Reference and COM Object Reference provide signatures and code examples in multiple programming languages.  
  
 You can customize your view of the content in the reference pages to display information only in your preferred programming language. To select a custom language, use the **Language Filter** button in the upper-left corner of the reference page. After it is enabled, the language filtering is persisted until it is changed. When language filtering is enabled on a page, the name of the language follows the title in the blue bar at the top of the page.  
  
 **Viewing Host Integration Server Help in Visual Studio**  
  
 You can view Host Integration Server Help in three ways:  
  
-   In Visual Studio, select **Contents** on the **Help** menu.  
  
-   In Visual Studio Help, select **Microsoft Visual Studio** from the **Programs** menu.  
  
-   In the stand-alone Microsoft Host Integration Server Help, select **Host Integration Server Documentation** from the **Programs, Microsoft Host Integration Server** menu.  
  
 If you are developing in Visual Studio, either of the first two methods is recommended. Using either of these methods enables integration between Host Integration Server Help and Visual Studio Help. Integration is useful when you navigate class relationships across the documentation sets. If you view Host Integration Server Help outside of Visual Studio, read the following tip to make sure links render correctly in Visual Studio.  
  
 **Linking between Host Integration Server Help and Microsoft Visual Studio Help**  
  
 When a member is inherited from the .NET Framework Base Class Library, two links are provided, as shown in the following example:  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Finalize** (inherited from **System.Object**)|For more information about the System namespace, see .NET Framework Help available from Visual Studio or go to [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=9677](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=9677).|  
  
 If you are viewing Host Integration Server Help in Visual Studio or in Visual Studio Help, the link in the left column goes to the exact member page. If you are viewing Host Integration Server Help outside of Visual Studio, use the link in the right column to go to the System namespace page in MSDN Library. Note that the link will not go to the specific member page.
