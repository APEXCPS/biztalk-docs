# DL-BASE/DMOD Interface
This section describes the interface to the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] DL-BASE. It includes a listing of the entry points that an application such as a 3270 emulator can call. These entry points allow messages to be sent to and received from services such as the local 2.1 node.
