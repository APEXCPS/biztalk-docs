# Endpoints Tab (TCP/IP Listener Properties)
The **Endpoints** tab displays the defined endpoints in the local environment definition. The controls on the **Endpoints** tab are read-only. To add or remove endpoints from the local environment, use the **Properties** shortcut menu item on the **Local Environments** node.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**New port or service name**|Not used.|  
|**Defined ports or service names**|View the valid ports and services names for the local environment.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When viewed from the ***listener*** node, the endpoint properties are read-only. If you want to change an endpoint property, right-click the specific ***local environment* Node** under the **Local Environments Node**, and then left-click **Properties** on the shortcut menu. The properties on that page are read-write.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  The properties of an application are not intended to be set or changed programmatically. Setting or changing the properties programmatically might cause the application to function incorrectly.
