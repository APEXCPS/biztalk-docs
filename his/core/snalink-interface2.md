# SNALink Interface
The SNALink interface specifies how an Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV) link DLL fits into the SNA link service architecture provided by the Base/DMOD interface. This section describes the SNALink interface, the entry points that an IHV link DLL can call, and those functions that a link service must provide to the Base/DMOD interface. These entry points allow messages to be sent to and received from the local 2.1 node.
