# Administration and Management Samples
The source code for several sample programs that illustrate using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for administration and management of [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] are included in the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] SDK. These files are copied to your hard drive during Host Integration Server software or Host Integration Server Client software installation when you select the **Host Integration Server Software Development Kit** option. These samples are installed in the Samples\NetworkIntegration\Administration subdirectory below where the [!INCLUDE[hishostintegrationserver2009](../includes/hishostintegrationserver2009-md.md)] SDK is installed (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Host Integration Server 2010\SDK, by default).  
  
 These sample programs include the files in the following subdirectories:  
  
|File or subdirectory|Description|  
|--------------------------|-----------------|  
|\VBScript|A WMI sample script written in Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) that illustrates how to import and export configuration information from Host Integration Server.|  
|\Scripts|The main page of a WMI sample script written in Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) for retrieving configuration information from Host Integration Server using WMI.|  
|\ASP-SNAWebAdmin|Subsidiary pages of WMI sample scripts written in Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) for retrieving configuration information from HIS using WMI. Each one of these subdirectories contains ASP sample scripts that illustrate how to retrieve information from Host Integration Server on a specific feature.|  
  
 Several sample programs (with source code) that illustrate administration and management are provided with HIS.
