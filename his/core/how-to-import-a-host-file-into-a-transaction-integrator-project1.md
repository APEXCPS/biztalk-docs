# How to Import a Host File into a Transaction Integrator Project
Once you have created a library in your Transaction Integrator (TI) project, you can import a Host Definition file. After you import the host definition file, you can modify the interfaces using Host Integration Server (HIS) Designer.  
  
### To import a Host File into a TI project  
  
1.  If you have a Host Definition file (.hcd) file available, you can use the Import COBOL Wizard or the Import RPG Wizard to define your interfaces.  
  
     For more information, see [How to Import COBOL into a TI Component](../core/how-to-import-cobol-into-a-ti-component1.md) or [Importing RPG](../core/importing-rpg2.md).  
  
2.  If you have a previous .NET client library that you want to base your new object on, you can use the Import Library tool to import the library into your project.  
  
     For more information, see [How to Import a TI Component](../core/how-to-import-a-ti-component1.md).
