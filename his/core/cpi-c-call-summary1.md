# CPI-C Call Summary
This section briefly describes each Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) call. The features provided by a CPI-C call can be broader than this section indicates. The calls are grouped in categories according to the function they perform. There are calls that start and stop a conversation, send and receive data, get information, and get side information.
