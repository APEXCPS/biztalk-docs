# Deployment Questions
Whether your enterprise consists of a single office or many branches spread throughout the world, SNA Open Gateway Architecture (SOGA) offers three flexible deployment models to implement Host Integration Server in your environment.  
  
 When planning your deployment strategy, ask the following questions:  
  
-   With what type of host systems do I need to connect?  
  
-   What kind of performance and host availability do my users expect?  
  
-   What kind of networking infrastructure is in place?  
  
 By answering these questions and using the information provided in this section, you can determine the best deployment strategy for your enterprise.
