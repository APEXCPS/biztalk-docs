# CPI-C Samples
The Host Integration Server SDK includes the source code for several sample programs that illustrate using Common Programming Interface for Communications (CPI-C) for transaction programs (TPs).  
  
 These files are copied to your hard drive during Host Integration Server software or Host Integration Client software installation when the Host Integration Server SDK option is selected. These samples are installed in the Samples\NetworkIntegration\CPI-C subdirectory below where the Host Integration Server SDK software is installed (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Host Integration Server 2010\SDK, by default).  
  
 These sample programs include the files listed in the following table.  
  
|Sample TP program|Description|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|[APING and APINGD](../core/aping-and-apingd.md)|Sample programs that provide a simple test for end-to-end connectivity.|  
|[Multithreaded APINGD](../core/multithreaded-apingd.md)|A multithreaded connectivity test that illustrates nonqueued behavior in Microsoft Windows.|  
|[CPI-C Send and Receive TPs](../core/cpi-c-send-and-receive-tps.md)|A pair of simple CPI-C TPs that illustrate the use of asynchronous CPI-C calls.|  
|[AREXEC and AREXECD](../core/arexec-and-arexecd.md)|A pair of TPs that execute commands on a remote computer and send the output back across the connection.|  
|[AREMOTE](../core/aremote.md)|A sample client and server program using APPC that enables you to invoke and control a text-mode program from another computer. This sample using APPC was based a Win32 sample program that originally used named pipes.|
