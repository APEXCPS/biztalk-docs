# Export MSI File Wizard, Destination Page
Use the **Destination** page to specify the name of the application as well as the full path, including file name, of the .msi file. The application name that you provide will be included in the list of application names from which you can select for the application when you import it from the .msi file.  
  
## UIElement List
