-   **Stop**. Sets the host instance to a Stopped state.  
  
-   **Restart**. Stops and then starts the host instance.  
  
-   **Delete**. Deletes the selected host instance.  
  
-   **Refresh**. Updates the host instance with the latest configuration and status.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the **Host Instance Properties** window.
