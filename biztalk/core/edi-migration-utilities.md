# EDI Migration Utilities
The EDI migration utilities shipped with previous versions of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] were used to migrate Base EDI applications to use the EDI solution provided as part of BizTalk Server 2006 R2 or BizTalk Server 2009. Migrating Base EDI applications directly to [!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)] is not supported. You must first migrate the Base EDI applications to BizTalk Sever 2006 R2 or BizTalk Server 2009 using the EDI migration utilities shipped with these versions of [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and then use the Party Migration Tool shipped with [!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)] to migrate the party definitions from BizTalk Server 2006 R2 or BizTalk Server 2009 to [!INCLUDE[prague](../includes/prague-md.md)].  
  
 For more information about the Party Migration Tool, see [Migrating EDI Artifacts from a Previous Version of BizTalk Server](../Topic/Migrating%20EDI%20Artifacts%20from%20a%20Previous%20Version%20of%20BizTalk%20Server.md).
