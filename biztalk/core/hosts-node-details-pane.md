# Hosts Node, Details Pane
Use the Hosts node details pane to manage hosts in the BizTalk Server group. Right-click a specific host to display the following commands:  
  
-   **Cluster**. Displays the **Cluster Host Instances** dialog box, which adds all host instances of the selected host to the selected cluster resource group. When you assign host instances to a cluster, you enable this set of host instances to operate as a single highly available host instance.  
  
-   **New**. Displays a submenu containing the following command:  
  
    -   **Host Instance**. Displays the **Host Instance Properties** window, which you can use to configure a new host instance on the specified server that is already joined to the group.  
  
-   **Delete**. Deletes the selected Host and associated host instances.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the **Host Properties** window.
