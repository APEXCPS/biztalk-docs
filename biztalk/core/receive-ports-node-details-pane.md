# Receive Ports Node, Details Pane
Use the Receive Ports node details pane to control and manage receive ports in the application. Right-click a specific receive port to display the following commands:  
  
-   **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.  
  
-   **Tracking**. Displays the **Receive Port Tracking Options** window. This window is identical to the **Tracking** tab in the **Receive Port Properties** window.  
  
-   **New**. Displays a submenu containing the following command:  
  
    -   **Receive Location**. Displays the **Receive Location Properties** window, where you can configure a new receive location as a child of the selected receive port.  
  
-   **Delete**. Deletes the selected receive port and its child receive locations.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the **Receive Port Properties** window.
