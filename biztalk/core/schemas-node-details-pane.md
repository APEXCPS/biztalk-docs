# Schemas Node, Details Pane
Use the Schemas node details pane to manage schemas in the application. Right-click a specific schema to display the following commands:  
  
-   **Remove**. Removes the selected schema from the application, and undeploys the assembly that contains it and the other components of that assembly. The application must be stopped before you can remove a schema.  
  
-   **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the **Schema Properties** window.
