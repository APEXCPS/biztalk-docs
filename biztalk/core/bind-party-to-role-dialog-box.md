# Bind Party to Role Dialog Box
Use the **Bind Party to Role** dialog box to bind a party, which is an organization or application with which your organization has a business relationship, to a role, which is the function that the party provides, such as procurement or shipping. Parties are created and managed at the group level, and binding parties to roles enlists a party into a specific BizTalk Server application.
