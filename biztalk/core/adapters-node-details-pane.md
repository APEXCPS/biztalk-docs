# Adapters Node, Details Pane
Use the Adapters node details pane to manage adapters. Right-click a specific adapter to display the following commands:  
  
-   **New**. Displays a submenu containing the following commands:  
  
    -   **Send Handler**. Displays the **Adapter Handler Properties** window, where you can configure a new send handler for the type of adapter selected in the details pane. Adapter objects that do not support send handlers (such as POP3) do not display a **Send Handler** command.  
  
    -   **Receive Handler**. Displays the **Adapter Handler Properties** window, where you can configure a new receive handler for the type of adapter selected in the details pane. Adapter objects that do not support receive handlers (such as SMTP) do not display a **Receive Handler** command.  
  
-   **Delete**. Deletes the selected adapter.  
  
-   **Refresh**. Updates the adapter with the latest configuration and status.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the **Adapter Properties** window.
