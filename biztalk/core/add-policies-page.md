# Add Policies Page
Use the **Add Policies** page to select the policies that you want to add to the application. The policy must exist in the Rule Engine database for the group, it must be published, and it cannot already exist in another application in the same group. For the policy to take effect in the application, you must deploy it.  
  
 When you add a policy, its associated vocabularies are also added.
