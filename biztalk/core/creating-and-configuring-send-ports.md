# Creating and Configuring Send Ports
This section provides instructions on using the [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Administration console to create and configure send ports for a BizTalk application. A send port is a location to which messages are sent or from which messages are received and is uniquely identified by its name.
