# Setup Wizard, Welcome Page
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  We recommend that you refer to the latest version of the [!INCLUDE[bts2010R2](../includes/bts2010r2-md.md)] Installation Guide at [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=269585](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=269585).  
  
 The basic installation process for Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is the same as for most Windows-based applications. The [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] Setup program calls Windows Installer to install [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] and the related components. Setup coordinates the installation process from beginning to end, terminating when the last component is installed. If you don't have a component, Setup is able to install prerequisites from the Web or a pre-downloaded CAB file.  
  
 With a simplified Installation Wizard, a component updater, and one-click configuration, installing and configuring [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] is more straightforward and efficient than ever before.
