# Filter Expression Dialog Box
You can use the **Filter Expression** dialog box to specify filter expressions for Receive shapes. You use a filter expression to express conditions under which a Receive shape receives messages.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Property**|Select a property to be referenced on incoming messages.|  
|**Operator**|Select an operator to determine the nature of the comparison.|  
|**Value**|Specify a constant value to compare the property against.|  
|**Group By**|Control predicate grouping. **AND** means the predicate is grouped with the predicate that follows it, while **OR** means the predicate is separated from the predicate the follows it.|  
|Up and down buttons|Move a selected row up or down in the expression.|
