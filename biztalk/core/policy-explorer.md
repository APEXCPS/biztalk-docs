# Policy Explorer
Use the **Policy Explorer** to manage policies and rules in the rule store. You can create, modify, and delete policies and rules, and you can test, publish, deploy, and undeploy policies.  
  
 Use the shortcut menu to access the following options.  
  
|Use this|To do this|  
|--------------|----------------|  
|**Add New Policy**|Create a new policy (rule set).|  
|**Add New Version**|Create a new empty version of the selected policy. You can copy rules from other versions and paste them into the new version.|  
|**Copy (Policy Version)**|Copy the selected policy version to the clipboard.|

|**Reload**|Reload the selected policy version and its rules, with the option to discard any current changes made in that version and restore the contents from the rule store.|  
|**Deploy**|Deploy a published policy version. You must deploy a policy version in order to make it available to rule-based applications.|  
|**Undeploy**|Undeploy a policy version. Once a version is undeployed, it is no longer available to rule-based applications.|  
|**Test Policy**|Test the selected policy version prior to deployment.|
