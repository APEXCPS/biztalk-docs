# Export MSI File Wizard, Dependencies Page
Use the **Dependencies** page to review the list of other applications on which the application to be exported depends. Before you can import the application from this .msi file into a BizTalk group, the referenced applications that are listed on this screen must exist in the group. In addition, in order for the application to run properly, when the application is started any items on which this application depends must already exist on each computer on which the application is installed.
