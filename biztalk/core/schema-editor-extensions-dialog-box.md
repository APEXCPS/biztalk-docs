# Schema Editor Extensions Dialog Box
Use the **Schema Editor Extensions** dialog box to select which extensions to associate with this schema. Typically, such extensions provide additional properties for some of the node types in a schema tree that you use to store whatever additional characteristics exist for that type of schema. These characteristics are persisted as annotations associated with the relevant node in the schema.

Further, depending on the particular extension, a custom view of the schema may be available on a tab adjacent to the **XSD** tab.|
