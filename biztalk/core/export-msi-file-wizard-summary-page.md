# Export MSI File Wizard, Summary Page
This is the final page of the Export Wizard. If the export operation was successful, the application artifacts have been exported into an .msi file in the path that you specified. You can now import this .msi file into another BizTalk group to create the application and its artifacts in the new group. You can also install the application onto a computer running [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] by using the .msi file.  
  
 If the export was unsuccessful, the page displays the location of the log file for the export operation. You can check this file for information that will help you troubleshoot the problem. After checking the log file or noting its location, click **Finish**.
