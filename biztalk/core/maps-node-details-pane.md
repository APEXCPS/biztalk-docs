# Maps Node, Details Pane
Use the Maps node details pane to manage the maps that enable orchestrations to process documents. Right-click a specific map to display the following commands:  
  
-   **Remove**. Removes (un-deploys) the selected map from the application, and undeploys the assembly that contains it and the other components of that assembly. The application must be stopped before you can remove the map.  
  
-   **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the **Map Properties** window.
