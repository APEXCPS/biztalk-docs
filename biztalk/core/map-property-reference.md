# Map Property Reference
The various objects that you work with when using BizTalk Mapper, such as links and functoids, as well as the map file itself (as displayed in Solution Explorer), have properties. The values for most of these properties can be specified and viewed in the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window. Map item properties are an exception; they are specified and viewed in a \<map file name> Property Pages dialog box.  
  
 This section provides reference information about these properties, and organizes them according to the type of object with which they are associated.
