# Group Shape
You can use the **Group** shape to group actions in an intuitive and visually manageable way. You can collapse or expand a task to show or hide the actions within it, which can be helpful when working with large, complicated orchestrations. It is not saved as part of the underlying codeâ€”it is a graphical construct for your convenience.
