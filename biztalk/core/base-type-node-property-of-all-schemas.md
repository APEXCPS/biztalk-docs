# Base Type (Node Property of All Schemas)
Use the **Base Type** property to examine the base complex type for the selected **Equivalent** node.  
  
## Applies to Nodes of Type  
 [Equivalent](../core/equivalent-node-properties.md)  
  
## Category  
 General  
  
## Read-Only Value  
 The name of the base data type for an **Equivalent** node.  
  
## XSD Persistence  
 None. The **Equivalent** node and its properties exist to display the type derivations occurring within the XSD, but have no direct XSD persistence. The values of the **Base Data Type** and **Data Structure Type** properties of the associated nodes can be viewed as a form of indirect XSD persistence.  
  
## Remarks  
 You can examine this property in the [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Properties window when you select an **Equivalent** node in BizTalk Editor.
