# Cosine Functoid
Use the **Cosine** functoid ( ![](../core/media/scientificcos.gif "scientificcos")) to return the cosine of an angle.  
  
## Input  
 **Parameter 1:** A numeric value that is an angle, specified in radians, for which the cosine is sought.  
  
## Output  
 **Output 1:** A numeric value that is the cosine of the specified angle.  
  
## Remarks  
 This functoid performs the following trigonometric calculation, where for a right triangle, A is one of the acute angles, H is the length of the hypotenuse, and S is the length of the other adjacent side.  
  
 Cosine(A) = S / H (cosine of angle is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse)  
  
 A radian is a unit of measure of angles, such that there are 2π radians in a circle. It follows that:  
  
-   2π radians equals 360 degrees  
  
-   1 radian = 180/π degrees  
  
-   1 degree = π/180 radians
