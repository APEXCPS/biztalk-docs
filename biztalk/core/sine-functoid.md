# Sine Functoid
Use the **Sine** functoid ( ![](../core/media/scientificsin.gif "scientificsin")) to return the sine of an angle.  
  
## Input  
 **Parameter 1:** A numeric value that is an angle, specified in radians, for which the sine is sought.  
  
## Output  
 **Output 1:** A numeric value that is the sine of the specified angle.  
  
## Remarks  
 This functoid performs the following trigonometric calculation, where for a right triangle, A is one of the acute angles, H is the length of the hypotenuse, and O is the length of the side opposite the angle.  
  
 Sine(A) = O / H (sine of angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse)  
  
 A radian is a unit of measure of angles, such that there are 2π radians in a circle. It follows that:  
  
-   2π radians equals 360 degrees  
  
-   1 radian = 180/π degrees  
  
-   1 degree = π/180 radians
