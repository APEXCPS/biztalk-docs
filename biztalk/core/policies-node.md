# Policies Node
Use the **Policies** node to view, add, and manage policies associated with the current application. Right-click the **Policies** node to display the following commands:  
  
-   **Add**. This menu item displays a submenu containing the following command. **Add** is not available on the **Policies** node under **\<All Artifacts>** or **BizTalk.System**.  
  
    -   **Policy**. Displays the **Add Policy** dialog box, which you use to associate a policy with the current application. Policies that have been published and are not currently part of another application are available for addition.  
  
-   **Export**. Displays the **Export Policies** dialog box, which you can use to selectively export policies and vocabularies to an *.xml file.  
  
-   **Import.** Displays the **Import Policies** dialog box, which you use to import policies (rules) into the BizTalk group. **Import** is available only on the **Policies** node that appears under **\<All Artifacts>**.
