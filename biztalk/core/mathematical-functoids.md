# Mathematical Functoids
**Mathematical** functoids are used to perform a variety of basic mathematical operations.  
  
 The number of input parameters to the **Mathematical** functoids varies from functoid to functoid, and where reasonable, these functoids accept large numbers of inputs. For example, the **Division** functoid requires exactly two input parameters (the dividend and the divisor), while the **Addition** functoid accepts between 2 and 100 input parameters, resulting in their sum.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Because Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServerNoVersion](../includes/btsbiztalkservernoversion-md.md)] uses the underlying functionality of the .NET Framework, the results produced by some of the **Mathematical** functoids may vary from the equivalent functoids in previous versions of BizTalk Server. Test your maps thoroughly to be sure you are getting the results you expect.  
  
 The **Mathematical** functoids are: [Absolute Value](../core/absolute-value-functoid.md), [Addition](../core/addition-functoid.md), [Division](../core/division-functoid.md), [Integer](../core/integer-functoid.md), [Maximum Value](../core/maximum-value-functoid.md), [Minimum Value](../core/minimum-value-functoid.md), [Modulo](../core/modulo-functoid.md), [Multiplication](../core/multiplication-functoid.md), [Round](../core/round-functoid.md), [Square Root](../core/square-root-functoid.md), and [Subtraction](../core/subtraction-functoid.md).
