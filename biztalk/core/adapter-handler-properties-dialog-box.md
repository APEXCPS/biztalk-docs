# Adapter Handler Properties Dialog Box
Use the **Adapter Handler Properties** window to create and configure new adapter instances and to review and configure information for existing adapter instances. An adapter handler is a host that is responsible for executing the adapter and contains properties for a specific instance of an adapter.
