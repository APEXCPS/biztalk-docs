# Tangent Functoid
Use the **Tangent** functoid ( ![](../core/media/scientifictan.gif "scientifictan")) to return the tangent of an angle.  
  
## Input  
 **Parameter 1:** A numeric value that is an angle, specified in radians, for which the tangent is sought.  
  
## Output  
 **Output 1:** A numeric value that is the tangent of the specified angle.  
  
## Remarks  
 This functoid performs the following trigonometric calculation, where for a right triangle, A is one of the acute angles, S is the length of the non-hypotenuse adjacent side, and O is the length of the side opposite the angle.  
  
 Tangent(A) = O / S (tangent of angle is the opposite side over the adjacent side)  
  
 The tangent of an acute angle is sometimes informally referred to as "rise over run."  
  
 The **Tangent** functoid performs the inverse operation of the **Arc Tangent** functoid.  
  
 A radian is a unit of measure of angles, such that there are 2π radians in a circle. It follows that:  
  
-   2π radians equals 360 degrees  
  
-   1 radian = 180/π degrees  
  
-   1 degree = π /180 radians
