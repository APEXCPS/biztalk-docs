# Pipelines Node, Details Pane
Use the Pipelines node details pane to manage pipelines in the application. Right-click a specific pipeline to display the following commands:  
  
-   **Remove**. Removes the selected pipeline from the application, and undeploys the assembly that contains it and the other components of that assembly. The application must be stopped before you can remove a pipeline.  
  
-   **Move To Application**. Displays the **Move to Application** dialog box, which you use to move artifacts from the current application in the Administrative Console to a different application.  
  
-   **Tracking**. Displays the **Pipeline Tracking Commands** window. This window is identical to the **Tracking** tab in the **Pipeline Properties** window.  
  
-   **Properties**. Displays the **Pipeline Properties** window.
