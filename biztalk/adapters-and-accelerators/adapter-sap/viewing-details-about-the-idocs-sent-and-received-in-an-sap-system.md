# Viewing Details About the IDOCs Sent and Received in an SAP System
Using the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)], you can send an IDOC to an SAP system or receive an IDOC from an SAP system. To track the status and view the data of an IDOC sent or received by an SAP system, you can use transaction WE02. For more information about this transaction, contact your SAP administrator or refer to the SAP documentation.
