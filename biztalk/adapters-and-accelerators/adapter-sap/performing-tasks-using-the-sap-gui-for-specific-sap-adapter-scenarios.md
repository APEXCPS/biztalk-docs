# Performing Tasks Using the SAP GUI for Specific SAP Adapter Scenarios
For many scenarios involving the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap](../../includes/adaptersap-md.md)] and the SAP system, you need to perform certain operations on the SAP system. For example, to receive an RFC call into the [!INCLUDE[adaptersap_short](../../includes/adaptersap-short-md.md)], you must first send an RFC from the SAP system. This section lists the high-level steps for performing such operations on the SAP system.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To perform these tasks, you must contact your SAP administrator or refer to the SAP documentation.
