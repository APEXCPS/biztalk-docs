# Understand the architecture and different components of the WCF LOB Adapter SDK
Read about the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] to help understand the different components, and the role of WCF.  

The [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] is a collection of tools and components that provide a consistent framework for developing reusable, metadata-rich adapters for line-of-business systems. Adapters written using the [!INCLUDE[afproductnameshort](../../includes/afproductnameshort-md.md)] are surfaced as custom WCF bindings and can be consumed by a WCF-capable client.  
  
## Features and components overview
[Understand the architecture and different components of the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/understand-the-architecture-and-different-components-of-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) provides an overview of the features and components that make up the SDK.

## Concepts  
[Fundamental Concepts](Fundamental%20Concepts.md) describes the metadata, connection management, and describes the common WCF terms.

## WCF  
[Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation Line of Business Adapter SDK](Microsoft%20Windows%20Communication%20Foundation%20Line%20of%20Business%20Adapter%20SDK1.md) explains the relationship with the SDK and WCF.

## SDK Overview  
[WCF LOB Adapter SDK Managed Reference](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk-managed-reference.md) explains the different handler types, channel implementation, connection details, metadata, and more.
  
## Connection, handler, metadata, custom, and core components
[Key Components of the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](../../adapters-and-accelerators/wcf-lob-adapter-sdk/key-components-of-the-wcf-lob-adapter-sdk.md) describes these different components.

## BizTalk Server and the SDK  
[BizTalk Adapter for Oracle Database and the WCF LOB Adapter SDK](BizTalk%20Adapter%20for%20Oracle%20Database%20and%20the%20WCF%20LOB%20Adapter%20SDK.md)
