# Preparing for the Double Action Tutorial
Before you start this tutorial, you must do the following:  
  
-   Perform a full installation of [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]Â® [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] on two computers. For more information, see the installation instructions.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  You must make sure that the additional configuration for [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] has been performed. This includes starting the BTARN orchestrations. For more information, see Additional Configuration of Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet.  
  
-   This tutorial simulates a real-world scenario by using two computers instead of a single computer with a loopback agreement. Whenever this tutorial uses computer names, it uses a placeholder. You have to replace that placeholder with the actual computer name you chose. For example, if the computer that is running your Contoso solution is named **Contoso**, replace any occurrences in the tutorial of \\\\<contoso**_***computer*> with that computer name.  
  
-   This tutorial promotes secure communication through certificates between Contoso and Fabrikam. You must generate any certificates you require and install them on their respective computers.
