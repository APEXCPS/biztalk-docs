# What&#39;s New in BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet
[!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]Â® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] works on a platform that includes [!INCLUDE[btsBizTalkServer2006r3](../../includes/btsbiztalkserver2006r3-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs2012](../../includes/vs2012-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[SQLServer2008or2005](../../includes/sqlserver2008or2005-md.md)]. The feature set in [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] is comparable to the feature set in the previous version. In working with [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)], however, you can take advantage of the enhanced features in the new versions of BizTalk Server, Visual Studio, and SQL Server.  
  
## References to Previous Versions  
 Some topics in the [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_abbrev](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-abbrev-md.md)] might be referring to older versions for BizTalk Server, Visual Studio, SQL Server, Windows, or BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet. Even though the version numbers listed are for the previous releases, in most cases the information present in those topics might still be applicable for the current release.
