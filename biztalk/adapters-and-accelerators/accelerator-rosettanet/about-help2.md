# About Help
The [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]Â® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)] Help uses HTML to format and display information. The Help Viewer provides an integrated table of contents and a full-text Search feature so that you can find information easily. Book icons open to reveal underlying books and topics. To expand the table of contents and view topics within a book, click the expand indicator (+) next to a book title. When you click the collapse indicator (-), the expanded topics are hidden. The Help Viewer also lets you see the table of contents or search results at the same time that you are viewing a Help topic.  
  
 The Help Viewer includes the **Favorites** tab that you can use to mark topics. Using this tab, you can quickly display topics that you refer to frequently.  
  
 To learn more about [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)], you can use the table of contents to browse through the documentation. When you click a topic in the table of contents, information appears in the content pane of the Help window.
