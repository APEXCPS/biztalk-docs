# Developing
This Software Development Kit (SDK) provides information for developers who are creating applications using any one of the tools in [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)]Â® [!INCLUDE[BTARN_CurrentVersion_FirstRef](../../includes/btarn-currentversion-firstref-md.md)], the public application programming interfaces (API), or the samples and utilities provided in the [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] SDK.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Help contains features that you can use to display the developer documentation in your preferred language and to link between [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Help and [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Help.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Class Reference provides signatures and code examples in multiple programming languages. The following tags represent the language-specific information:  
  
 **[C#]**  
  
 **[Visual Basic]**  
  
 **[C++]**  
  
 **[JScript]**  
  
 You can customize your view of the content in the reference pages to display only information in your preferred programming language. To select a custom language, use the **Language Filter** button in the upper-left corner of this page. As soon as it is enabled, language filtering persists until it is changed. You can see that language filtering is enabled on a page, because the name of the language follows the title in the blue bar at the top of the page.  
  
 You can view [!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)] Help in three ways:  
  
-   In the [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] development environment  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Help  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[btsCoName](../../includes/btsconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[btaBTARN3.3abbrevnonumber](../../includes/btabtarn3-3abbrevnonumber-md.md)]  
  
 If you are developing in [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)], either of the first two methods are recommended. Using either of these methods enables integration between BTARN Help and [!INCLUDE[btsVStudioNoVersion](../../includes/btsvstudionoversion-md.md)] Help. This integration is extremely useful when navigating class relationships across the documentation sets.
