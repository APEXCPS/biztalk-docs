# Troubleshooting
There are a number of actions that you can take to troubleshoot BizTalk Server management pack issues:  
  
-   Ensure that Operations Manager is installed properly.  
  
-   Ensure that Operations Manager configuration settings are set properly.  
  
-   Verify that your import of the Management Pack is complete and successful.  
  
-   Ensure that all relevant entities are enabled, such as rules and monitors.  
  
-   Ensure that the computer groups are populated with the correct computers. You can use the **Authoring** mode **Groups** node in the console to perform this inspection.  
  
-   Ensure that all the SCOM agents are healthy.  
  
-   Ensure that the heartbeat interval is set properly and that the rules are propagated to the Operations Manager 2007 R2/2012 agent computer.  
  
-   Ensure that all performance counters are properly installed.
