# Monitoring SQL Servers
The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] management pack provides both proactive and reactive monitoring of [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServer2008R2](../includes/btssqlserver2008r2-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServer2008](../includes/btssqlserver2008-md.md)] in an enterprise environment. Availability and configuration monitoring, performance data collection, and default thresholds are built for enterprise-level monitoring. Both local and remote connectivity checks help ensure database availability.  
  
 With the embedded expertise in the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] management pack, you can proactively manage [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)], and identify issues before they become critical. This management pack increases the security, availability, and performance of your [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] infrastructure.  
  
 The Microsoft [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)] management pack guide that comes with the pack describes the content of the management pack, and describes how to deploy it. Features of the management pack include:  
  
-   Monitoring the state of the included services such as [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)], SQL Agent, Report Server, Notification Services  
  
-   Monitoring the state of databases  
  
-   Monitoring the available space in databases, configurable by % or MB  
  
-   Ensuring databases are configured correctly  
  
-   Ensure clients can connect to the [!INCLUDE[btsSQLServerNoVersion](../includes/btssqlservernoversion-md.md)]  
  
-   Monitor blocked processes  
  
-   Watch for failed agent jobs, and jobs taking an excessive time to execute  
  
-   Monitor the health of replication and alert on failures  
  
-   Monitor the state of Database Mirroring
