# BizTalk Server Tools

[**BizTalk Health Monitor**](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/biztalkhealthmonitor/ "BizTalk Health Monitor ")
This tool was created by the BizTalk support team to collect information about a BizTalk environment, including table usage and known issues. An report is generated with potential problem areas highlighted. Consider executing this tool and reviewing the output on a regular basis to help maintain your BizTalk environment. This replaces BizTalk MsbBox Viewer.

[**BizTalk Terminator Tool**](https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=2846 "BizTalk Terminator Tool")
This tool was created by the BizTalk support team to resolve common database integrity issues typically found in the BizTalk MsgBox Viewer output. Common tasks include removing instances and purging large tables.

[**Microsoft BizTalk LoadGen 2007**](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c8af583f-7044-48db-b7b9-969072df1689&displaylang=en "Microsoft BizTalk LoadGen 2007")
Microsoft LoadGen 2007 generates message transmission loads to run performance and stress tests for your Microsoft BizTalk Server applications, and provides performance counters to monitor the performance of the infrastructure running BizTalk Server.

[**BizTalk Server Best Practices Analyzer**](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=93d432fe-1370-4b6d-aaa8-a0c43c30f5ab "BizTalk Server Best Practices Analyzer")
The BizTalk Server Best Practices Analyzer performs configuration-level verification by reading and reporting only. The Best Practices Analyzer gathers data from different information sources, such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes, SQL Server databases, and registry entries. The Best Practices Analyzer uses the data to evaluate the deployment configuration. The Best Practices Analyzer does not modify any system settings, and is not a self-tuning tool.

[**Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL)**](http://www.codeplex.com/PAL "Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL)")
The PAL (Performance Analysis of Logs) tool is a new and powerful tool that reads in a performance monitor counter log (any known format) and analyzes it using complex, but known thresholds (provided). The tool generates an HTML based report which graphically charts important performance counters and throws alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

[**DebugView for Windows**](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx "DebugView for Windows")
DebugView is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local system, or any computer on the network that you can reach via TCP/IP. It is capable of displaying both kernel-mode and Win32 debug output, so you don't need a debugger to catch the debug output your applications or device drivers generate, nor do you need to modify your applications or drivers to use non-standard debug output APIs.

[**Log Parser 2.2**](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=890CD06B-ABF8-4C25-91B2-F8D975CF8C07&displaylang=en "Log Parser 2.2")
Log parser is a powerful, versatile tool that provides universal query access to text-based data such as log files, XML files and CSV files, as well as key data sources on the Windows operating system such as the Event Log, the Registry, the file system, and Active Directory.

[**Process Explorer**](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx "Process Explorer")
The unique capabilities of Process Explorer make it useful for tracking down DLL-version problems or handle leaks, and provide insight into the way Windows and applications work.

[**TCP Trace**](http://www.pocketsoap.com/tcptrace/ "TCP Trace")
Used to monitor text based network traffic between client and server. Useful while using adapters like SOAP,HTTP,POP3 etc to see the message travelling via the wire.

[**DTCPing**](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=5e325025-4dcd-4658-a549-1d549ac17644 "DTCPing")
This tool is designed to assist with troubleshooting Microsoft DTC Firewall Issues, which you'll often see in a multiserver BizTalk deployment.
